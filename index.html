            My primary interests lie in Programming, Machine Learning, Mechatronics, Control Theory and Modern Control with a particular focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques applications. Beyond academics, I enjoy playing the Kamancheh, a traditional Iranian instrument, and practicing Synchronized Swimming. I consider myself a passionate learner, always eager to explore new ideas and expand my knowledge; especially when research can contribute to meaningful industrial advancements.

            In my seventh semester I came back to working on the "Inverted Pendulum" project, as a project for two courses, using two different approaches to control this system. This project turned out to be one of the most interesting projects I have worked on during my time at Shahid Beheshti University. The following diagrams show the two different control structures that where applied to the Inverted pendulum.

                For the "Industrial Control" course, we implemented a PID controller on the pendulum. this controller worked quite well. Although the PID coefficients that we used were not exactly the same as the ones that worked in simulation, we had to change them a bit to get better result.

                For the "Modern Control Systems" course we implemented a state feedback controller on the pendulum. The state feedback controller used a state observer to estimate the system's four state. In this case the controller worked as well, although the simulation worked a lot better.
