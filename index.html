          <p>Hi!
            My name is Pariya Palizban, I have graduated from Shahid Beheshti University (SBU) of Iran in Electrical Engineering. With a GPA of 18.01/20 (3.84/4), I rank first among 60 students. My main interests are Programming, Machine Learning, Mechatronics, Control Theory and Modern Control, using Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods. Also, I play Kamancheh, which is an Iranian instrument, and I do Synchronized Swimming! I consider myself a passionate learner and I am very excited about learning new things and developing new ideas through research; especially if my research leads to making industrial improvements. </p>

          I learned C++ programming language in two courses offered by ACECR(Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research) when I was 15 and like all other Electrical Engineering students in our university, I was again taught C++ in the "fundamentals of programming" course in my second term. The final Project of this course was "Bignum Calculator". This calculator was able to use the main operations for numbers up to 100 digits. You can check the code for this project <a href="https://github.com/PariyaPl/BigNumCalculator/blob/main/BigNumPRJ.cpp">here</a> on my GitHub.

          I learned Verilog in the "digital logic" course of the university in my third semester.

            On my fourth term at the university, I took the "Digital Systems 2" course. As the final optional project for this course, I chose to make an "instrument tuner". This device took the sound and the name of the tunable note in as the input and showed a related pattern as the output. To do this I used an Arduino Uno board. You can check the Arduino code for this project <a href="https://github.com/PariyaPl/InstrumentTuner">here</a> on my GitHub.

            On my fifth term at the university, I took the "Power Electronics" course for which my team and I made a "Half bridge inverter" as an optional project. To me, the most interesting part of this project was using CodeVisionAVR on Atmega8 to apply PWM and MPWM to the inverter.

The programming language I used for this project was Python, which I initially learned on course offered by the Shahid Beheshti University computer engineering student association and I later took the python courses on Coursera.

        <p class="experience-info invisible">
          For the "Digital Control Systems" course, I worked on a project about "controlling the output voltage of a wind turbine simulator" with a teammate. The goal was to make an automatic mode for a turbine simulator setup that was in the lab. We used Arduino to read the output voltage from a ZMPT101B sensor and send it to a PLC by serial communication. in order to control the output voltage and keep it in a safe small range, we designed a PID controller using NI LabVIEW.

            For the "Fundamentals of mechatronics" course, we made an "Inverted Pendulum" and used an Arduino board to apply an LQR controller to it. Although I did not consider this project over yet; because the controller did not give the best result. Therefor I came back to working on this project during my seventh term again.

          The summer after My Sixth term, I was an intern at a company in Iran, for which I worked on a research related to the image recognition of traffic signs. Therefore I also studied to gain <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AbJ-weynq1V9DeLWMT-Hn3D5xH8JsUYO/view">Coursera certificates for Deep Learning</a>. And to come to a better understanding of machine learning algorithms, I also gained Coursera certificates for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fhmu6pJ_3UeFNCZMUGwe__qBCvCwj1-j/view">mathematics for machine learning</a>. Since Python programming language is used in many useful related applications, to make sure about my skills in this programming language, I also gained the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qI82ZLc5iuJ481JEvLYy3dR7-o0A8MmG/view">Coursera certificates for Python</a>.

            In my seventh semester I came back to working on the "Inverted Pendulum" project, as a project for two courses, using two different approaches to control this system. This project turned out to be one of the most interesting projects I have worked on during my time at Shahid Beheshti University. The following diagrams show the two different control structures that where applied to the Inverted pendulum.

                For the "Industrial Control" course, we implemented a PID controller on the pendulum. this controller worked quite well. Although the PID coefficients that we used were not exactly the same as the ones that worked in simulation, we had to change them a bit to get better result.

              <p class="imagii-info">
                For the "Modern Control Systems" course we implemented a state feedback controller on the pendulum. The state feedback controller used a state observer to estimate the system's four state. In this case the controller worked as well, although the simulation worked a lot better.
