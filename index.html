          <p>My main interests are Programming, Machine Learning, Mechatronics, Control Theory and Modern Control, using Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods. Also, as a personal interest I play Kamancheh, which is an Iranian instrument, and I do Synchronized Swimming. I consider myself a passionate learner and I am very excited about learning new things and developing new ideas through research; especially if my research leads to making industrial improvements.

            In my seventh semester I came back to working on the "Inverted Pendulum" project, as a project for two courses, using two different approaches to control this system. This project turned out to be one of the most interesting projects I have worked on during my time at Shahid Beheshti University. The following diagrams show the two different control structures that where applied to the Inverted pendulum.

              <p class="approach-imagii-info">
                For the "Industrial Control" course, we implemented a PID controller on the pendulum. this controller worked quite well. Although the PID coefficients that we used were not exactly the same as the ones that worked in simulation, we had to change them a bit to get better result.

                For the "Modern Control Systems" course we implemented a state feedback controller on the pendulum. The state feedback controller used a state observer to estimate the system's four state. In this case the controller worked as well, although the simulation worked a lot better.

            The summer after My Sixth semester, I was an intern at a company in Iran, for which I worked on a research related to the image recognition of traffic signs. Therefore I also studied to gain <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AbJ-weynq1V9DeLWMT-Hn3D5xH8JsUYO/view" class="certificates">Coursera certificates for Deep Learning</a>. And to come to a better understanding of machine learning algorithms, I also gained Coursera certificates for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fhmu6pJ_3UeFNCZMUGwe__qBCvCwj1-j/view" class="certificates">mathematics for machine learning</a>. Since Python programming language is used in many useful related applications, to make sure about my skills in this programming language, I also gained the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qI82ZLc5iuJ481JEvLYy3dR7-o0A8MmG/view" class="certificates">Coursera certificates for Python</a>.

We used Arduino to read the output voltage from a ZMPT101B sensor and send it to a PLC by serial communication. in order to control the output voltage and keep it in a safe small range, we designed a PID controller using <span class="skills">NI LabVIEW</span>.
